                  In the current landscape of vehicle registration, the
                  traditional system is afflicted with drawbacks such as
                  inefficiencies and bureaucratic complexities and is
                  susceptible to fraudulent activities like false ownership
                  transfers, mileage tampering, insurance fraud, and so on. In
                  addition, the existing solution is time-consuming, involves
                  multiple stages, and relies heavily on the intervention of
                  government officials. As a result, the overall system lacks
                  transparency, which results in compromising the integrity of
                  the vehicle. Here lies the motivation for our project.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                  To address these critical issues, we propose the
                  implementation of <b>AutoLedger</b>, a blockchain-based
                  solution to de-centralize the processes of vehicle
                  registration, vehicle ownership, and maintenance of insurance
                  and servicing records. This ensures that vehicle records are
                  easily accessible, secure, and tamper-proof.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                  We implemented this project on <b>ResilientDB</b>, which is

                  California, Davis.

                  The primary goal of implementing <b>AutoLedger</b> is based on
                  the principles of transparency, consistency, and robustness of
                  vehicle records across various users and user-types. This
                  enhances data availability, resilience to faults, and the
                  security of vehicle records.

                <p class="lead">
                  While working on the project, we envisioned using blockchain
                  technology as an immutable key-value database to effectively
                  store the vehicle records, which provides a way to ratify the
                  records and also prevents tampering with them.

                <p class="lead">
                  <b>AutoLedger</b> leverages the power of blockchain for
                  decentralized and transparent vehicle registration. It allows
                  only DMV personnel to register a vehicle by committing the
                  records to the blockchain, ensuring authenticity. Also, it
                  allows Insurance and Servicing personnel to view and update
                  relevant information while preserving data privacy. The
                  vehicle owners can view the entire record, ensuring its
                  correctness. Finally, it provides DMV with exclusive access to
                  the vehicle records and rights to transfer vehicle ownership,
                  ensuring transparency and process robustness.

                  <b>AutoLedger</b> is a full stack application built by
                  utilizing React for the frontend and GraphQL server, Crow
                  server for the backend. The frontend manages the UI logic
                  associated with AutoLedger, while the backend seamlessly
                  processes requests from the frontend, efficiently invokes
                  various operations on the ResilientDB blochain, and delivers
                  precise responses to the frontend.

                  In the backend architecture of AutoLedger, we have employed
                  ResilientDB’s GraphQL server integrated with a Python SDK to
                  handle API calls from the React frontend. The GraphQL server,
                  which is hosted locally, internally communicates with the Crow
                  HTTP server (also locally hosted). The Crow server eventually
                  interacts with the KV server, ResilientDB’s blockchain
                  solution, which is a key-value store.

                  To facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and
                  backend, we have established a robust integration using the
                  GraphQL server. We have created the backend API endpoints on
                  the GraphQL server that are accessible to the React frontend
                  application. We have leveraged ResilientDB’s kv-server to
                  securely store user data and car data on the blockchain.

                <p class="lead">
                  Communication with ResilientDB’s KV server is achieved through
                  the HTTP Crow framework. Internally, the GraphQL server
                  invokes the Crow server, which, in turn, interacts with the KV
                  server to execute set and get operations on the blockchain
                  based on the invoked API. The GraphQL server then efficiently
                  returns the API’s response to the React application, ensuring
                  a streamlined and efficient integration between the
                  interfaces.
